pytm threatlib parse (Rules class)
- TODO - store controls/conditions in some way to represent boolean expression, currently stored as a simple list 
    - fix parse_pytm_threatlib
    - fix Rule.mitigated_threat function
- [INP17, SC05, AC22, DR01, DS06] don't have a capec, only cwe

testing
- test parent child
- test all functions of all elements
- assert tests
- clean up import logic

other
- rebase dev into main (main branch 2-3 commits ahead of dev)
- type annotation for different python versions (generic list type works currently with python 3.11, but would be better to have lists of specific types)
- there are some attributes in cwe.xml, capec.xml, and asvs.xml that are not used in the load functions in sources.py
- there are some class attributes for Threat, Weakness, and Control that are not used in the load functions in sources.py
- property getters/setters missing in various places
