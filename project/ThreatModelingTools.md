# Threat Modeling Tools

There have been several tools and domain-specific languages that have been previously developed to aid system designers with threat modeling. However, we found that many people don't actually use these tools, and when they do it's for diagramming mainly.  We expect this is because existing systems do not support the ad-hoc, flexible ways that we found software architects and threat modelers review systems when threat modeling in practice.

We recommend trying out a few of these tools. If you do not have Windows and want to try [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool) or [Threats Manager Studio](https://threatsmanager.com/), please use `vm-winresearch.eecs.tufts.edu`.
