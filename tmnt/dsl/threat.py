            In this case specifying which parts of STRIDE apply for the
            specified consequence. This assignment will be applied to a

            Options
            -------
            `Remote`
                The exploit scenario requires that the attack occurs over
                the network stack; normally external to the target's internal
                network such as from the Internet. Common targets in the remote
                theater are public websites, Domain Name System (DNS) services,
                or web-browsers.
            `Remote:Internet`
                An attack is able to originate over the internet.
            `Remote:Intranet`
                The attack must be launched from within an organizations
                internal network that is shielded from direct access of the
                Internet. (Ex: A router is configured by default to only allow
                connections from the Intranet ports and not the WAN ports.) This
                also represents broadcast domains.
            `Remote:Local network`
                An attacker must have access to a physical interface to the
                network, or collision domain.
            `Limited Remote`
                The exploit scenario requires that the attack can occur over
                layer 2 or layer 3 technologies, but a limitation exists either
                by the nature of the network communication or by range
                constraints.
            `Limited Remote:Bluetooth`
                The attack must be launched relying on a Bluetooth communication
                channel.
            `Limited Remote:Cellular`
                The attack must be launched from a cellular network.
            `Limited Remote:Infrared`
                The attack must be launched relying on an Infrared communication
                channel.
            `Limited Remote:Line of Sight`
                The attack must be launched using a Line-of-Sight system such as
                ocular.
            `Limited Remote:Satellite`
                The attack must be launched using Satellite communication
                channels.
            `Limited Remote:Wireless`
                The attack must be launched from a wireless (802.11x) network.
            `Local`
                The exploit scenario requires that the attack can only occur
                after the adversary has logical local access to a device such as
                through a console, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Secure Shell
                (SSH), or Telnet login.
            `Physical`
                The exploit scenario requires the attacker's physical presence
                at the target.
