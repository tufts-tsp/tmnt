class Finding(Element):
    """
    A finding consists of a Component(s), the associated Issue(s) and the
    identified Control(s). An Issue may be resolved by one or more Controls, or
    it may be deemed to not have sufficient risk to have a Control assigned, in
    which case the residual risk would be negligible.

    Finding is modeled off of the templates given in Table I-5 and Table I-7 of
    NIST 800-30. Use this document as guidance for filling in your finding.
